        Data warehouse is a database designed to enable business intelligence activities: it exists to help users to understand and enhance their organizationâ€™s performance. Data warehouse is storage of historical data for a business, an experiment or any other enterprise. It consists of selectively extracted data from a primary source or any other source inter-related with the primary data [3]. It reduces the cost-per-analysis due to the simpler and standardized structures in contrast to the application databases.

        In first chapter, we introduce concept and significance of data warehouse to the data mining and business process. In this chapel, we provide the comprehensive overview of project design and development process.

        <b>2.1 Purpose and Scope</b>
        <br/>
        <p>
        Motivation for this project comes from my own experience while studying the course CSC 177: Data Warehousing and Data Mining at California State University. While studying this course, we have to implement term project on data warehouse. Reading the book was not enough for summarizing data warehouse process. There was already one courseware implemented by previous student, which explains steps for designing data warehouse, but that application is browser dependent and required Internet connection to read. Me and my fiends was working on campus job and hoping if there is some way to read and understand without opening computer or internet connection, it would be really helpful. This incident gives me idea to make mobile application for explaining data warehouse with interesting example, so student or beginners of data warehouse can learn anywhere anytime.
        </p>
        <p>
        The purpose of the data warehouse is to provide aggregate data which is in suitable format for specific decision making.

        <p>
        The main purpose of the project is to provide on-hand information in your mobile for designing data warehouse to audience who is interested in learning concept of data warehouse designing. Additionally it serves as a platform for learning database concept.

        <b>2.2 Project Design and Development Process Overview</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>
        The courseware divides the topics for designing a data warehouse into four sections. Each section explains step by step process with example. There is also final demo of data warehouse progress after completing the each step to see the progressively view of resultant view.
        </p>
        <p>
        Project starts with basic introduction about data warehouse, which includes the basic concept, and applications where data warehouse is useful, basic architecture and different data modeling techniques used in data warehousing process.
        </p>
        <p>
        Section 1 explains how to identify the purpose and the requirements. This section also explains the information for selecting business process and implement basic data mart. This section helps the beginner to understand from where we should start data warehouse once we get data source. The second section helps to recognize the purpose of refining data mart and demonstrate the refining process using the previous section 1. The third demonstration shows the method of building an enterprise data warehouse using the data mart design from the former section. This also explains how to merge different data mart together and get answer of multiple queries of business process. The fourth section, gives the idea of aggregation technique in amplifying the performance of the data warehouse.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition to the topic explanation, each section also includes case study of implementing data warehouse for restaurant search. Each demonstration provides interactive user sessions to generate summary reports as per the user specifications [10]. The idea of case study is guided my Dr. Meiliu Lu, while explaining my project definition. She gives me idea of using interactive example which reader loves to read and easy to understand. Each restaurant has their own data and if some restaurants have multiple branches, then each branch has its own data. End user or marketing people needs all data together for better understanding of user interest and business progress to make future decision. Therefore, we realize that using a restaurant example is easy to explain and useful for end users for searching restaurant and finding people reviews in their daily life as well as helpful for marketing people to make business decision.
        </p>
        <p>
        Restaurant search case study can helps to get answer of searching restaurants near 20 miles of current location or search using area name. The result gives information of restaurant location, contact number, food category and people review about resultant restaurants. We use Yelp APIs to get restaurant data source. For more detail about each restaurant, like map, direction, detail information about each reviews and etc. are provided by redirecting to the yelp website.
        </p>

        Both courseware and sample implementations will be discussed in later chapters of this report. In next chapter, we will see what research has done during project design and development. Additionally I have presented courseware coverage details in next chapter.
